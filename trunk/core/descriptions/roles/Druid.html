<span style="font-family: blue;">Wisdom</span> is the most important ability score for all Druids, as it controls all aspects of their spellcasting.  <span style="float: left; width:auto; font-family: blue;">Dexterity</span> is also important for increasing the Druid's modest Armor Class and improving attack rolls with ranged weapons.
