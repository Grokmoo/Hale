type "Restoration"
description "The caster touches a single target, granting that target a layer of protection against negative magic attacks.  The next time a negative effect is applied to the target, it is immediately removed.  The spell lasts for 3 rounds plus one per three caster levels or until it removes an effect.  The list of spells that Ward provides protection from includes: Slow, Curse, Deafen, Blindness, Freeze, and Flaming Fingers.  Note that Ward does not protect from the initial damage from a spell, only from its lasting negative effects."
