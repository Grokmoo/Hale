description "Glacial Wave upgrades your Freeze spell.  A wave of magical cold radiates rapidly out from the caster with a radius of 25 feet, sucking all heat out of the area.  Creatures within the area must succeed at a physical resistance check or be frozen solid (paralyzed) for 2 to 4 rounds.  Even if the check is succesful, each creature suffers an Action Point penalty of 15 plus the caster level as well as taking 6 to 12 plus one per caster level cold damage."
